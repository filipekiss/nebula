> Nebula is a customizable Neovim configuration with friendly defaults for new comers

## Why Nebula?

Nebula is a project looking to provide a Neovim configuration that is fast,
easily customizable but also allows you to learn and understand what's happening
and how the configuration works.

I started working on Nebula when I was rewriting my Neovim configuration to make
use of the great Lua api. I came across a lot of other configuration sets that
provide very good defaults, but nothing that taught me how to write my own
configuration. So I decided to make a configuration that would try to not get in
your way and would allow you to slowly fully replace it.

The ultimate goal of Nebula is to allow you to have a starting point for your
configuration that's documented enough so you can understand what it does and
easily customize it, override it and finally remove it.
